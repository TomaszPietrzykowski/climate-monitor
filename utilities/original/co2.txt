# Estimated CO2 Daily Global Seasonal Cycle and Trend (ppm).
# 
# The estimated daily global seasonal cycle and trend value for CO2 are determined
# from the daily averaged CO2 data from the four NOAA GML Baseline
# observatories.  A smoothed seasonal cycle and a smoothed de-seasonalized trend
# curve are determined for each observatory record at daily intervals.  An
# estimated global seasonal cycle and trend are computed by averaging the four
# individual observatory seasonal cycle and trend curves at each daily interval.
# 
# For details on the curve fitting process see

# The uncertainty in the global annual mean is estimated using a monte carlo
# technique that computes 100 global annual averages, each time using a
# slightly different set of measurement records from the NOAA ESRL cooperative
# air sampling network.  The reported uncertainty is the mean of the standard
# deviations for each annual average using this technique. Please see
# Conway et al., 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a complete discussion.

# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
#
# The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation
# of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by
# NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

# Annual CO2 mole fraction increase (ppm) from Jan 1 through Dec 31.
#
# The uncertainty in the global annual mean growth rate is estimated using a
# monte carlo technique that computes 100 time series of global annual growth
# rates, each time using measurement records from a different sampling of sites
# from the NOAA ESRL cooperative air sampling network.  Each year has a different
# uncertainty.  Please see Conway et al., 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a
# complete discussion.  The last one or two years listed could have preliminary
# uncertainties set equal to the average uncertainty since 1980.
# Before 1980 the global growth rate has been approximated by taking the average
# of Mauna Loa and the South Pole, correcting for the offset between (MLO+SPO)/2
# and the global Marine Boundary Layer, as described in Ballantyne et al, 2012

# Monthly mean CO2 constructed from daily mean values
# Scripps data downloaded from http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2
# Monthly values are corrected to center of month based on average seasonal
# cycle. Missing days can be asymmetric which would produce a high or low bias.
# Missing months have been interpolated, for NOAA data indicated by negative stdev
# and uncertainty. We have no information for SIO data about Ndays, stdv, unc
# so that they are also indicated by negative numbers

# USE OF NOAA GML DATA
# 
# These data are made freely available to the public and the
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# ensure that GML receives fair credit for their work.  If the data
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,
# GML should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.
# If the GML data are essential to the work, or if an important
# result or conclusion depends on the GML data, co-authorship
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# the work.  Manuscripts using the GML data should be sent to GML
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# represented.

# RECIPROCITY
# 
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
# of the GML data, namely well documented model code, transport
# fields, and additional information necessary for other
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new
# users of the models.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, 
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
