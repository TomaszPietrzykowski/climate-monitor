% 
% Two versions of this average are reported.  These differ in how they treat

% presence of sea ice are extrapolated from land-surface air temperature anomalies.  
% In the second version, temperature anomalies in the presence of sea ice are
% extrapolated from sea-surface water temperature anomalies (usually collected 
% from open water areas on the periphery of the sea ice).  For most of the 
% ocean, sea-surface temperatures are similar to near-surface air temperatures; 
% however, air temperatures above sea ice can differ substantially from the water 
% below the sea ice.  The air temperature version of this average shows larger 
% changes in the recent period, in part this is because water temperature changes 
% are limited by the freezing point of ocean water.  We believe that the use of air
% temperatures above sea ice provides a more natural means of describing changes in 
% Earth's surface temperature.  
% 
% The percent coverage of sea ice was taken from the HadISST v2 dataset and varies
