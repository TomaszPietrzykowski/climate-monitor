NASA EARTHDATA

NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Insititute of Technology
Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)

The mission of the PO.DAAC is to preserve NASAâ€™s ocean and climate data and make these universally accessible and meaningful.

Since the launch of NASA's first ocean-observing satellite, Seasat, in 1978, PO.DAAC has become the premier data center for measurements 
focused on sea surface topography, ocean temperature, ocean winds, salinity, gravity, and ocean circulation.

In addition to providing access to its data holdings, PO.DAAC acts as a gateway to data stored at other ocean and climate archives. 
This and other tools and services enable PO.DAAC to support a wide user community working in areas such as ocean and climate research, 
applied science and industry, natural resource management, policy making, and general public consumption.
