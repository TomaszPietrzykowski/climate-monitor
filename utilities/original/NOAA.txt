The Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
conducts research that addresses three major challenges: greenhouse gas and carbon cycle feedbacks, 
changes in clouds, aerosols, and surface radiation, and recovery of stratospheric ozone.

GML has a vision of a Society using the best possible information to inform decisions on climate change, 
weather variability, carbon cycle feedbacks, and ozone depletion.

It's mission is to acquire, evaluate, and make available accurate, long-term records of atmospheric gases, 
aerosol particles, clouds, and surface radiation in a manner that allows the causes and consequences of change to be understood.
