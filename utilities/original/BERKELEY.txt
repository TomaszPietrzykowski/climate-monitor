Berkeley Earth

Berkeley Earth is an independent U.S. non-profit organization focused on environmental data science.

OUR MISSION AND PURPOSE
Global warming is the defining environmental challenge of our time.  The need for quality, unbiased scientific information about global warming could not be more urgent.  Yet there are few sources of historic global temperature records, the foundation underlying all global warming analysis.

OUR WORK
Berkeley Earth supplies comprehensive open-source world air pollution data and highly user-accessible global 
temperature data that is timely, impartial, and verified. From this foundation, we further question and investigate the 
nature of relationships between this data and timely human and environmental issues, such as ocean temperature and acidification. 
We communicate outcomes in peer-reviewed journals, global print and digital media, at conferences, and on our website.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has added another dimension to Berkeley Earthâ€™s work. As world-wide data and information 
become available we are collecting and analyzing the impact of the pandemic and its relationship to global warming, weather, 
climate, air quality, economic impact, and health. Our insights on these topics are being sought and in alignment with our mission, 
we aim to provide the highest quality independent investigations possible on these and related topics.
